## Udemy Projects

I have been using Udemy for all of my programming needs since I was in college. The projects in this folder use advanced methods to create different models for data sets that were provided by Udemy and Kaggle.

### List of Projects:
   - [Lending Club loan data analysis using Keras API](https://github.com/samdomeier/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Udemy_projects/LendingClub_loan_analysis_Keras_API.ipynb)
      > The goal: To build a model that can predict wether or not a borrower will pay back their loan based on historical data.

## Other Projects

### [2019 March Madness Predictions](https://github.com/samdomeier/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/MarchMadness_2019_predictions.ipynb)
> This project was inspired by the Kaggle competition - "Google Cloud & NCAAÂ® ML Competition 2020-NCAAM".

Due to the pandemic that we find ourself in these days, this competition was canceled. But, since I had more than 2 weeks of time put into this notebook, I decided to create a model that will predict the 2019 competition results. Avoiding any data leakage, all data used is prior to the 2019 tournament.

**Current Status:**

I am currently in the midst of creating the model. I have been focusing on my Springboard projects lately, so I hope to find time to complete this model in the near future.
