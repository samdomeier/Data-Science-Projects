## 2019 March Madness Predictions
> This project was inspired by the Kaggle competition - "Google Cloud & NCAAÂ® ML Competition 2020-NCAAM".

Due to the pandemic that we find ourself in these days, this competition was canceled. But, since I had more than 2 weeks of time put into this notebook, I decided to create a model that will predict the 2019 competition results. Avoiding any data leakage, all data used is prior to the 2019 tournament.

**Current Status:**

I am currently in the midst of creating the model. I have been focusing on my Springboard projects lately, so I hope to find time to complete this model in the near future.
